  <p>The DCCS was inspired by generic dynamic stocks and flows tasks,
   and based on the simplified and adapted climate model. Detailed description of 
   DCCS along with an experiment can be found in Dutt & Gonzalez (2008).</p>
   
   <p>The figure given below shows a simulated climate change stabilization task that you will
    be playing today for a period of 100 years. The task shows a tank with grey colored liquid which represents the  CO<sub>2</sub> concentration
    in the atmosphere. The  CO<sub>2</sub> concentration can be read from graduations placed on the left tank wall,as well as below the tank.

    </br>
  
    The label on the left of the tank shows goals for  CO<sub>2</sub> concentration to be attained in the future.
    Also, the graphics at the left bottom shows the trajectory of total  CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and  CO<sub>2</sub> absorptions.
     You start in the year 2000 when the  CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in the atmosphere is 762 GtC (or billion tons of carbon) and total emissions equal 8.12 GtC/year.Also it contains a graphical representation of thermometer which shows the temperature of atmosphere in relation with concentration of carbon-dioxide in the current year.
    In year 2000, the value of  CO<sub>2</sub> absorptions was half of the total  CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and equaled 4.077 GtC/year and measured temperature is 25 degree celcious</p>
  <p>We want you to estimate the future  CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and  CO<sub>2</sub> absorptions so that your  CO<sub>2</sub> concentration 
  traces the goal trajectory. For accomplishing this,
   please enter the values of total  CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and  CO<sub>2</sub> absorptions in the corresponding text 
   boxes . You can only enter total  CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and  CO<sub>2</sub> 
   absorptions values that are within the FROM and TO ranges. Upon entering the total  CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and 
    CO<sub>2</sub> absorptions, you need to press the "Make Decision" button. This will make the task move forward in time by a year where the total  CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and absorptions you entered will come in and go out of the atmospheric tank in that year changing the  CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. The total  CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and absorptions you entered will also be plotted in the graphics below(where the blue line
   gives the total  CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and black line will give the  CO<sub>2</sub> absorptions you entered</p>
