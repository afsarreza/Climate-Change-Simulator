Consider the issue of global warming. In 2001, the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a scientific panel organized by the 
United Nations, concluded that carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and other green-
house gas emissions were contributing to global warming. The panel 
stated that“most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is
attributable to human activities.”
</p>
<p>The amount of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere
is affected by naturalprocesses and human activity. Anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub>
emissions (emissions resulting from human activity, including combust-
ion of fossil fuels and changes in land use,especially deforestation),
have been growing since the start of industrial revolution (Figure 1).
Natural processes gradually absorb CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere (for example,
as it is used by plant life and dissolves in the ocean). Currently,the 
absorptions of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> by natural processes is about half of the
anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. As a result,concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> in the at-
mosphere have increased, from preindustrial levels of about 600 GtC to
about 769 GtC today (Figure 2).</p>

<p>Now consider a scenario in which the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere gradually rises to 938 GtC, about 22% higher than the level today, then stabilizes by the year 2100 as shown here:</p>

<p>The graph below shows anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from 1900-2000, and current absorptions of CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere by natural processes.Next, you will be asked to sketch:</p>
<p>a. Your estimate of likely future CO<sub>2</sub> absorptions, given the scenario above.</p>
<p>b. Your estimate of likely future anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, given the scenario above. <br><br> </p>
